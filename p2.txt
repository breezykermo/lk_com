Jo Freedman said it well: it is a utopian embrace of 'structurelessness' has
made possible this 'star' system, in which the substance of democracy is
charisma and media fluency, not a mathematics of the majority. We take this
reality show seriously at FA, I often think, where our theory of value is
tangled up and probably even rooted in an economics of attention, the span of
which gets shorter and shorter by year.
