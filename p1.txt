It is one of the softer mornings in Berlin. Brisk air, cold breath, sunlight.
Dark chocolate and coffee on my tongue.  I'm thinking back to ARG week
fourteen, when you and I traced the gap between formal and informal structures
of authority, labour, accountancy at FA, in that dingy old charm of a pub,
theatre that it supposedly doubled as.
