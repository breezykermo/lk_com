I've been using [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink)
(DT) idly for almost two years now. For those who aren't familiar with the
application, you can basically think of it as an extra layer on top of the Mac
operating system for working with documents (PDF, images, RTF, etc) more
effectively. It has inbuilt PDF viewing and annotation, facilities for syncing
documents between computers and tablets (iOS only), powerful search capacities,
lateral tagging to associate documents with each other, and-- most importantly--
a scripting API to create custom workflows.

I've recently determined that I'll be starting a PhD, and as part of the 
preparation for it I've been ironing my reading, writing, and archiving workflow.
It's designed primarily with seminars, essays, and book-length projects in the
humanities in mind-- but I've tried to make it general and flexible enough to
work with other contexts, such as scientific reading, as well.

This explanation is split into two sections. In the first section, I'll present
a specification of how I want to read, write, and archive in abstract terms. In
the second section, I'll detail the way that I've configured and customized DT
to implement that spec in practice.  Hopefully its helpful/instructive for some
folks out there who similarly work with networks of citations in reading and
writing projects, or who keep a personal archive of PDFs. 

A note for readers looking to use the configurations and scripts I detail here:
DT is not free, and it's Mac-only. (I'm looking into virtualising it so that
I can run it in Linux, but that project is yet to begin.) There is a generous
150-hour free trial, but after that you'll need to make one-off payment of $99
USD for the standard version on desktop.  I'm more than willing to pay for good
software like DT, and you should be too.  Developing and maintaining software
takes time and effort. I'm very grateful to the folks at DEVONthink keeping up
with the community, and keeping the software feature-rich and flexible.
