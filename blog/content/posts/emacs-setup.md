I've worked through a number of note-taking logics over the years.
When I was an undergraduate, I kept a swath of [GrowlyBird notes](https://growlybird.com/notes/).
Around 2015, I switched to [Bear notes](https://bear.app/), and dabbled with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) in 2016 or so (when it was still relatively niche).
Through time working at [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org), I moved towards visual tools like [Mural](https://mural.co/) and [Miro](https://miro.com/) (and have found that [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) also works well in this class of tools).
In personal thinking these days, I mostly stick to Mural, as I have visual networks there that it doesn't make sense to try to port into any other tool.
More often though, I just use [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) to quickly whiteboard ideas, and save the `.tldraw` files if I think I'll find those sketches useful in the future.

I check in with the [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) communities from time-to-time, but ultimately feel the same way about note-taking as I do about my coding editor: I want shortcuts, hyperlinks, and suggestions, but I want it in a terminal. 
I'm already comfortable in a terminal; I know what fonts I like, I know how to UNIX through text to search and replace: I don't need a new GUI for what are, at core, hypertextual notes.

In most things programming, I have been a vim/[neovim](https://neovim.io/) user since 2018.
But it's damaging to be a die-hard in anything.
Especially vim, as I learned the hard way trying to develop [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) applications in Java with it.
(When I finally 'gave in' and starting using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), it was incredible how much more code I could understand and write.)
So in early 2020, I fell into using emacs to experiment with [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/), a markup format and ecosystem of tools that I initially wanted to adopt to replace the deprecated [Wunderlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderlist) (which I used extensively from 2013-2020).
At the suggestion of [zacoppotamus](https://github.com/zacoppotamus), I booted up [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) and pulled together [a config](https://github.com/breezykermo/.doom.d) that works for me.
