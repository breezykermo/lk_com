<h1 class="title">Associative Archiving with DEVONThink (Part I)</h1>
<p class="author">Lachlan Kermode</p>
<p class="date">28 February 2020</p>

<div class="main-content">
<p>I've been using <a
href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DEVONthink</a>
(DT) idly for almost two years now. For those who aren't familiar with
the application, you can basically think of it as an extra layer on top
of the Mac operating system for working with documents (PDF, images,
RTF, etc) more effectively. It has inbuilt PDF viewing and annotation,
facilities for syncing documents between computers and tablets (iOS
only), powerful search capacities, lateral tagging to associate
documents with each other, and– most importantly– a scripting API to
create custom workflows.</p>
<p>I've recently been ironing my reading, writing, and archiving
workflow. It's designed primarily with seminars, essays, and book-length
projects in the humanities in mind– but I've tried to make it general
and flexible enough to work with other contexts, such as scientific
reading, as well.</p>
<p>This is a two-part post. Here in part I, I'll present a specification
of how I want to read, write, and archive in abstract terms. In <a
href="./devonthink-part-ii.html">Part II</a>, I'll detail the way that
I've configured and customized DT to implement that spec in practice. I
hope this can be helpful/instructive for some folks out there who
similarly work with networks of citations in reading and writing
projects, or who keep a personal archive of PDFs.</p>
<p>A note for readers looking to use the configurations and scripts in
Part II: DT is not free, and it's Mac-only. (I'm looking into
virtualising it so that I can run it in Linux, but that project is yet
to begin.) There is a generous 150-hour free trial, but after that
you'll need to make one-off payment of $99 USD for the standard version
on desktop. I'm more than willing to pay for good software like DT, and
you should be too. Developing and maintaining software takes time and
effort. I'm very grateful to the folks at DEVONthink keeping up with the
community, and keeping the software feature-rich and flexible.</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>My archival philosophy is built on the principle of projects. At any
given time, I have a number of projects underway. A project might be an
idea for an essay, an essay I'm actively writing, a coding project, a
reading group, a talk I'm preparing- essentially any undertaking that
collects together relevant links, quotes, notes, texts, and other
files.</p>
<p>These projects much more actively organise my archive than perhaps
more familiar taxonomic concepts such as author or date. When I'm
reading and writing, I store relevant information in my archive
according to where it's going in my work– in projects– rather than where
it's coming from. Say I'm reading a book, and a particular paragraph
sticks out at me as a relevant reference for an essay I'm writing: I
want to save that quote (and perhaps some relevant additional thoughts
regarding why the quote is relevant) in the essay as a project. Provided
I can get back to the correct page in the source document from what I
save, I don't need to file the entire book in the project; just the
relevant quotes and my additional annotations.</p>
<p>When I go to work on a project, I can bring up its file of
quotations, annotations, and my own personal notes. Quotations are
hyperlinked to their source text, so that I can go to its origin to cite
or further explore, but my main project workspace is a
readily-accessible collection of relevant quotes and notes.</p>
<p>A single note/quote could be relevant to arbitrarily many projects.
Notes can exist in a project without a source document, thoughts that
occur to me in the course of conversations and everyday life. The source
documents might be either a PDF or a webpages. (Hardcopy books can't be
hyperlinked, so quotes for these are just traditionally referenced by
page number).</p>
<h1 id="project-workspaces">Project workspaces</h1>
<p>When I open up project workspace, I want to be able to easily and
immediately view all of the relevant quotes and notes. I want to be able
to dynamically search through the workspace in a number of ways: for
particular text, filtering to only notes from a particular book, only
notes from a particular author, only notes written after a certain date,
etc. In other words, the project workspace search is where I need the
more traditional taxonomic notions to organise my files. I don't want to
have to click through nested file structures to get to relevant notes,
but instead be able to flexibly filter and compose notes.</p>
<p>The notes in projects should contain everything I need to use and
expand the thought in a project. The project workspace is where I sift
through these thoughts, putting them to use in the project, whether that
be towards code, writing, conversation, or whatever else.</p>
<h1 id="an-associative-archive">An associative archive</h1>
<p>Projects are the main way to interface the archive for writing.
However, I also want to be able to search through the archive as a
whole, without limiting search results to the confines of a project.
This search should, like the search in project workspaces, be similarly
flexible and support search by author, by date added, etc.</p>
<p>Crucially, I also want to be able to add durable filters to the
archive's search space. For example, I might want to be able to see all
notes and documents from a particular seminar, all those published by
University of California Press, or all those that come recommended by a
particular person. A document or note can have an arbitrary number of
these tags, so that it can be infinitely associated with other items in
relevant groupings.</p>
<p>This notion of flexible and associative tagging essentially replaces
the need for folders in the archive. Folders seem to tend towards nested
hierarchical structures of organisation. I try to keep <em>as few
hierarchical layers as possible</em> in my tagging system. This keeps me
diligent regarding the tags I add to my archive, encouraging fewer of
them and ensuring that the ones I do add are expressive and
memorable.</p>
<h1 id="the-inbox">The inbox</h1>
<p>The only extra capacity this system needs is a clean, clear workflow
for adding new documents to the archive, reading them, and then marking
them as 'done'. I work through documents like I work through email. They
enter into an inbox, and I read them there, creating new quotes and
notes in different projects as I read. When I'm done, I flick them into
the archive. Documents either come into my inbox fresh from somewhere
else (the web or a hard drive). Or, if I'm returning to a document to
read a different chapter, or to read one again, it might come back into
my inbox from the archive. In other words, my inbox consists of all the
documents I'm actively reading. If I'm adding a bunch of documents to my
archive from elsewhere and <em>not</em> immediately planning to read
them, they only hang out in my inbox for long enough to be tagged with
any relevant filters, and are then filed away.</p>
<p>The idea that a document can be either a PDF or a webpage is crucial
to how this inbox works for me. For a long time I kept webpages to read
in browser bookmarks, and PDFs elsewhere, which inevitably ended up in
never actually reading bookmarked folders. Having a unified inbox for
all my documents means that I <em>have to</em> work systematically
through them to keep a clean inbox, just like an email inbox.</p>
<p>Another important aspect my inbox is how it works with documents I
read elsewhere. I read almost all my PDFs, EPUBs, and MOBIs on my <a
href="https://remarkable.com/">Remarkable</a>, where I underline things
and write in the margins. When I've finished with a document on my
Remarkable, I bring it into my archive inbox, and browse quickly back
through the marginalia. This practice of 'second-reading' my own notes
on a text helps to solidify what I took from it, and gives me the
opportunity to spin off relevant quotations and marginalia as notes to
projects. I have a system for reading with my computer open as well,
annotating and typing notes as I go through it, but I largely prefer
reading elsewhere (outside, in the sun!) and then second-reading in my
archive's inbox, before filing it away. Similarly, if I take notes in
notebooks on my remarkable, I second-read them in my archive before
filing.</p>

have implemented the archive explained here in practice with
